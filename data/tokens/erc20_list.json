With 0xcert protocol, we can validate a proof of existence, authenticity, and ownership of these digital assets without third-party involvement.\r\n\r\nThe protocol also uses fungible tokens known as ZXC as utility tokens in the system and comply with the ERC20 standard on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e blockchain.

This distinguishes FUZE as a token created entirely for its community.\r\n\r\nWhat’s the purpose of the FUZE project?\r\nOur main goal is to build a community that decides in which direction the FUZE Token should go. Future functions or use-cases can be built by any member of the community. Of course, the main function right now is the deflationary token model — this means the total supply decreases with each transaction.\r\n\r\nWhy a deflationary token?\r\nWe like the concept of this kind of token model because it exemplifies the hodler mentality.

Every transaction on the network must include some gas, and the fee paid to miners for each transaction is directly proportional to the gas consumed by a transaction. GasToken allows a transaction to do the same amount of work and pay for less gas, saving on miner fees and costs and allowing users to bid higher gas prices without paying correspondingly higher fees.

It is solving the urgent problem of scalability and high fees by implementing a variant of optimistic roll-ups. Most notably, Cartesi is revolutionizing smart contract programming by allowing developers to code with mainstream software stacks instead of Solidity. Noether is Cartesi's side-chain that’s optimized for ephemeral data, providing low-cost data availability to DApps.\r\n\r\nWhat makes Cartesi Unique?\r\n\r\nWhat gives Cartesi a competitive edge is that it allows developers to code their smart contracts and DApps directly with mainstream software components and Linux OS resources. This is a breakthrough for the productivity of existing DApp developers and for the adoption of non-blockchain developers. This is a necessary step to the very future of blockchains and their applications. In addition, key highlights include:\r\n\r\nTransaction scaling: 20-fold+ TPS increase over Ethereum\r\n\r\nComputational sca...",

Using a combination of permanent liquidity locks and a fixed supply currency, Rootkit creates a mathematical price floor. There can only ever be 10000 ROOT, and the price floor represents the lowest possible price a ROOT token can ever be. With our new ERC-31337 token wrapper, Rootkit is able to unlock the ETH from under the price floor and send it to a vault. This ETH is moved without effecting the market price, or depth of the order book. As the price floor rises through market volume, liquidity locks. Which means more ETH is unlocked from below the floor and sent to the vault. Because there is no tokens available to sell, the floor starts at the price, which is determined by how many ETH are raised in the ETH. Since we can unback the KETH below the floor, all of the ETH used to create the first liquidity can be used twice. This lets us offer our first LP a huge bonus, which is something n...",
